I was just hoping to query Java versions in relation to allowing our version of Sage to run. \n \nWe are currently using Sage ERP 1000 v4.0  9.

The current version of Java we are using has been identified as a vulnerability.\n[HISTORY] [REDACTED_NAME] information I have from [REDACTED_NAME], states your version of [REDACTED_NAME] will only run between [REDACTED_NAME] 1.8.0_144 up to 1.8.0_191 ([REDACTED_NAME] 8 [REDACTED_NAME] 144 to 191).
