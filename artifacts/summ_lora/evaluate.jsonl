[REDACTED_NAME] order H513562 is missing the top level product code ‘OALGSTHD’. [REDACTED_NAME] components appear to be listed and these downdate from stock. [REDACTED_NAME] order H514474 is missing the top level product ‘OPPLOSHD’ . [REDACTED_NAME] orders shouldn’t be FOC and should have the value which has been invoiced hence £143.43 (excl VAT) for H513562 and £182.08 (excl VAT) for H514474. [REDACTED_NAME] does seem to have been downdated…as the component parts downdate not the top level product (which isn’t on the order anyway)!
