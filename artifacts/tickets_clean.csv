Please see attachment of our  report that got done at month end.

To run this report, we do the following 
	Sage - Manufacturing - works order processing - reports - works order status.
Hit enter and put an 'i' in the status required field (first cell) – enter
Run it and save it down (maudit).
 
Our understanding is that the report would show work orders that are left, but the report shows the full cost:

Please see print screen for example. The total cost is 10,424.99 for the Qty of 12. However, the report shows that 2 Qty have been finished but this has not been reduced this from the full amount.


 

This print screen shows the journal that has been posted in the month based of the stock history. The full for the WO  comes back to 9999.99 giving a difference of 9.99 and we are trying to understand how we have this difference from the stock history to the .

 

Please can you confirm:
-	Why doesn't the [REDACTED] report show the material costs left anywhere?
-	Why was is the [REDACTED] order  figure different on the stock history to the WIP Report?

Thanks,

There is a process that my team do and I just want to check if there's a way to improve it. 

At the moment when a purchase invoice comes in and it has a [REDACTED] to match against it, our purchase ledger clerk has to ask another team member to go into the  screen below. Then they have to click 'authorise', go out of the order and go back in where it will ask 'post immediately' and they have to click 'yes'. 

Is there a reason why this doesn't just post immediately? I'm not sure what benefit this step is adding? If you need details of which screens we go into etc please contact  (cc'd) and he can advise.","user is not set up as a pop user so currently is unable to authorise and post POP invoices
